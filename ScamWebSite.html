    <h2 style =Advanced PC users may be able to fix Microsoft Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1 or 10 problems by manually editing the registry or removing individual keys found to be corrupt or invalid, as well as applying other manual PC bug fixes. Users may seek professional help from an IT technician, who can help avoid a full PC crash, fix PC power supply and other hardware, as well as clean the computer from issues that may be causing stability problems or general malfunctions. However, since any manipulations with the registry always carry a risk of rendering the operating system unbootable, whenever a user is in any doubt of their technical skills or knowledge, they should only use special software that provides safe PC fixes and is meant to fix system Issues and other computer problems without requiring any special skills.

    What are the symptoms of Windows Issues?
    The most common symptoms of Windows Issues are application or system freezes (when an application or the whole system stops responding to mouse clicks or any other user actions for a brief period of time, but later returns to normal operation), application or system crashes (when an application or the whole system stops responding to user actions and nothing can bring it back to normal operation; application has to be terminated or a PC reboot is required), random computer reboots that are not initiated by the user, various error messages or BSOD ("blue screen of death" or the "STOP Error"), as well as connectivity issues that cannot be fixed by adjusting network settings. Problems with software uninstalls or reinstalls can also be a sign that PC needs to be repaired.The most common symptoms of Windows Issues are application or system freezes (when an application or the whole system stops responding to mouse clicks or any other user actions for a brief period of time, but later returns to normal operation), application or system crashes (when an application or the whole system stops responding to user actions and nothing can bring it back to normal operation; application has to be terminated or a PC reboot is required), random computer reboots that are not initiated by the user, various error messages or BSOD ("blue screen of death" or the "STOP Error"), as well as connectivity issues that cannot be fixed by adjusting network settings.
